## Introduction

This repository contains all the projects built during the learning track to become a FullStack developer. Since I started out this path, I needed this repository to practice all the programming I need to start working as a developer. To be able to write this code is wonderful and an incentive to pursue this new career. It is very challenging, but I am sure it is worth it.

## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
